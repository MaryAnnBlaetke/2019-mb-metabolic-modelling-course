In experimental settings the \"environment\" is usually constituted by the growth medium, ergo the concentrations of all metabolites and co-factors available to the modeled organism. However, constraint-based metabolic models only consider fluxes. Thus, you can not simply use concentrations since fluxes have the unit `mmol / [gDW h]` (concentration per gram dry weight of cells and hour). \n","\n","Also, you are setting an upper bound for the particular import flux and not the flux itself. There are some crude approximations. For instance, if you supply 1 mol of glucose every 24h to 1 gram of bacteria you might set the upper exchange flux for glucose to `1 mol / [1 gDW * 24 h]` since that is the nominal maximum that can be imported. There is no guarantee however that glucose will be consumed with that flux. Thus, the preferred data for exchange fluxes are direct flux measurements as the ones obtained from timecourse exa-metabolome measurements for instance. \n","\n","So how does that look in COBRApy? The current growth medium of a model is managed by the `medium` attribute.
