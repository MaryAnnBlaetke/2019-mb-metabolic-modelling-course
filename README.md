# Metabolic Modelling Course @ CompBioStarter2019


## Part 1 - Introduction
In the first part of this course, we will discuss the importance of mathematical modelling to enhance the understanding of real-world systems and to make predictions about the system's behaviour. 
Next, we will focus on metabolic networks, their construction and purpose and the application of flux balance analysis to investigate the flux distribution optimised for specific criteria subjected to a set of constraints.

## Part 2 - Exercise
In the second part of this course, we will go through the [cobrapy](https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/) Tutorial provided at [ReadTheDocs](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to learn about the very basics, from loading to manipulation/building models to perform a simple FBA and beyond.

### Working Environment
We use the [python](https://www.python.org) as a programming language and the [cobrapy](https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/) package for constraint-based modelling of biological networks, which is part of the [openCobra](http://opencobra.github.io) project. 
For live coding, we will use the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) implementation at [Google Colabratory](https://colab.research.google.com/). 
Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualisations and narrative text. If you prefer to run your own Jupyter Notebook instance, we recommend installing it via [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org).

### Requirements
Some experience in coding, preferably using python. 
Resources for learning python can be found at:
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python)
* [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/q:python)
* [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/topic/python/)
* [Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org)
* [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming#tutorial)
* [More...](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers)
